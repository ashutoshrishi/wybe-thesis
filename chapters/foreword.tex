\chapter*{Foreword}

I want to thank Dr. Peter Schachte for giving me the opportunity to work with
him on his new programming language project, the Wybe language and compiler. It
is a great learning experience and immense fun. I wanted to use this section to
highlight my exact contributions to this compiler code base, since it was
already well under construction before I started my research project, and the
discussion in this thesis covers more than just my contributions.

I joined the compiler project at the stage when the entire front-end and LPVM
Intermediate Representation transformation was already in place. Since then, I
have worked on extending the compiler code base to include translation of the
logic IR, LPVM, to the LLVM IR and the machine code generation from that. With
the guidance of Dr. Schachte, I have also been working on adding the
incremental features, discussed in this thesis, into the compiler, including
the work on the build system. Essentially our work flow is divided at the LPVM
IR stage. Dr. Schachte works on extending the language and its translation to
LPVM, whereas I work on the rest of the back-end stages thereafter,
incorporating his changes and extending the incremental features.
