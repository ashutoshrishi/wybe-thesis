\chapter{Abstract}

Intermediate languages in compilers glue two different compiler construction
phases. Being machine independent makes it possible for an IR structure to
transform from one form to another to allow different patterns of reasoning,
and different stages of transformation. In this thesis the proposal of a
logical language based IR is explored by inserting it in a incremental compiler
pipeline as a mid-level IR. This IR lies in between the source code and the
LLVM IR, enabling Logic Programming analyses to be used for optimisation before
the usual LLVM optimisation. Using this compilation pipeline we build an
incremental compiler which is focused on LP analyses and reusing IR structures
already built in previous instances compilation of a target.
