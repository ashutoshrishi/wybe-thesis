% C++ incremental compiler
@article{cpp_compiler,
Abstract = {The authors propose an effective incremental compilation environment called “Barbados,” which is based on the C++ language. The environment is similar to an interpreter in that alterations to source code appear to be immediately reflected in all object code, except that errors are reported early as in compiled systems. The system is significantly faster than traditional environments at bringing applications up-to-date after minor modifications. It is also simpler, more general, and more efficient than competing incremental compilation systems.},
